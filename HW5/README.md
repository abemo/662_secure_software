Using either the Flask micro framework (for Python) or Express (for JavaScript), complete the web app we did in class in our unit on Web Security. Keep everything we did in our code-along, including for instance storing salted hashes of passwords with pbkdf2, storing JWTs in cookies for authentication, and preventing XSS and CSRF attacks. You will just need to add the following:

  [ ]  A completed implementation of the transfer functionality.
  [ ]  User enumeration defense.
  [ ]  A nice README in your GitHub repo.
  [ ]  Very extensive comments within the source code of how exactly you defend against XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, User enumeration, etc. Comment on your validations and your error handling. Part of your learning experience should be showing and explaining what you learned, so give this project some thought.

Reminder, good passwords are passphrases like "From the palm tree, take 8 steps to the west, then dig a hole in the sand."
