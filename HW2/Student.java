/*
 * MET01-J. Never use assertions to validate method arguments
 * 
 * Never use assertions to validate arguments of public methods.
 * The Java Language Specification, ยง14.10, "The assert Statement" [JLS 2015], states that
 * assertions should not be used for argument checking in public methods. Argument checking
 * is typically part of the contract of a method, and this contract must be upheld whether
 * assertions are enabled or disabled.
 * 
 * A secondary problem with using assertions for argument checking is that erroneous arguments
 * should result in an appropriate run-time exception (such as IllegalArgumentException,
 * IndexOutOfBoundsException, or NullPointerException). An assertion failure will not throw an
 * appropriate exception.
